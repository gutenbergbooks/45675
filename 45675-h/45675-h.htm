      <span class="i0">False rhymes the most atrocious upon earth,<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">Which might move <span class="smcap">Momus</span> to derisive mearth.<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">Of Rhyme's true laws I'm getting to the root,<br /></span>

      <span class="i0">The Muse, now by the few acknowledged fair,<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">Shall then be warmly welcomed everywhair,<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">And not, as now, in one loud howl sonorous,<br /></span>

      <span class="i0">The people then not hymns alone shall praise,<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">But the sweet secular singer's luscious laise,<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">Phonetic laws to wish to change at once<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">Must prove a man a duffer and a donce,<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">The laws of spelling are less fatal foze.<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">(You can spell "does" as either "duz" or "doze,"<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">And if you wish to make it rhyme with bosh,<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">What easier than writing wash as "wosh"?)<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">If <span class="smcap">Tennyson</span> were all rewritten <i>thus</i>,<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">His verse indeed would be de-li-ci-us;<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">And <span class="smcap">Isaac Pitman's</span> spelling would add lots<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">Of charm to the great works of <span class="smcap">Isaac Wotts</span>.<br /></span>

<h2>LITERARY INTELLIGENCE.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Sea-side Library.</i></p>

<p><i>Visitor (wearily, after a series of inquiries
and disappointments).</i> What I want is a
<i>recent</i> novel. I haven't read <i>The Vermilion
Gillyflower</i> yet. It's been out six months or
more. Surely you've got <i>that</i>?</p>

<p><i>Shop Attendant.</i> I don't <i>fancy</i> it's in our
catalogue. I don't <i>remember</i> hearing of it.
(<i>Brightly.</i>) We've got <i>Ivanhoe</i>.</p>

<p><i>Visitor (ignoring the suggestion).</i> Well,
then, I could do with <span class="smcap">Conan Doyle's</span> last,
or <span class="smcap">Stanley Weyman's</span>.</p>

<p><i>Shop Attendant.</i> <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>, did you say?
Oh yes, we've <i>ordered</i> the <i>Life of Dean
Stanley</i>, but it hasn't come yet.</p>

<p><i>Visitor (gloomily).</i> I don't want anybody's
life. I want&mdash;let's see&mdash;<i>A Gentleman of
France</i>.</p>

<p><i>Shop Attendant.</i> <i>A Gentleman of France?</i>
I don't recollect the title. But (<i>cheerfully</i>)
we've <i>John Halifax, Gentleman</i>, if that'll
do as well.</p>

<p><i>Visitor (groaning).</i> Oh no, it won't! How
about <i>So-so</i>, by <span class="smcap">Benson</span>, you know? Or I
hear Mrs. <span class="smcap">Clifford's</span> latest is worth reading.
Or <i>Bess of the Curvybills</i>, by <span class="smcap">Hardy</span>.
That's been out a couple of years at least.
(<i>Hopefully.</i>) Oh, I'm sure <i>that</i>'s got to you.</p>

<p><i>Shop Attendant (floored).</i> Would you look
through the shelves for yourself, if you
please? You'll find <i>something</i> to suit you, I
<i>know</i>. There's one or two of <span class="smcap">Dickens's</span>, and
<i>Middlemarch</i>&mdash;now, <i>that</i>'s a rather recent
work. Or <i>The Channings</i>. We've had <i>The
Channings</i> bound again, and it's a <i>great</i>
favourite.</p>

of the Birmingham Police Force&mdash;not
by any means Brummagem detectives&mdash;disguised
themselves as "Mourners' Mutes"
and such like black guards of hearses, and,
after a re-hearsal of their several parts, they
went to a tavern for drink&mdash;grief, professionally
or otherwise, being thirsty work&mdash;and
managed to discover that this public-house
was only a privately conducted betting-house,
being, like themselves, in disguise. The
result has yet to be ascertained, but so far it
has proved a most successful "undertaking."</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself, uncomfortably conscious of the expectant</i>
<span class="smcap">Thomas</span> <i>in his rear</i>). Must write <i>something</i> to this beggar, I suppose;
it'll keep him quiet. (<i>To</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Brooke-Chatteris</span>.) I&mdash;I just
want to write a line or two. Could you oblige me with a lead-pencil?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris.</i> You are really going to write! At a dinner-party,
of all places! Now <i>how</i> delightfully original and unconventional
of you! I promise not to interrupt till the inspiration is
over. Only, really, I'm afraid I don't carry lead-pencils about with
me&mdash;so bad for one's frocks, you
know!</p>

<p><i>Thomas (in his ear).</i> I can lend
you a pencil, Sir, if you require
one.</p>

<p><i>Archie (to himself).</i> The calm
cheek of these writin' chaps! I
saw him takin' notes under the
table! Lady <span class="smcap">Rhoda</span> ought to
know the sort of fellow he is&mdash;and
she shall! (<i>To</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Rhoda</span>,
<i>in an aggrieved undertone</i>.) I
should advise you to be jolly
careful what you say to your
other neighbour; he's takin' it
all down. I just caught him
writin'. He'll be bringing out a
satire, or whatever he calls it, on
us all by-and-by&mdash;you see if he
won't!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> What an ill-natured
boy you are! Just
because <i>he</i> can write, and you
<i>can't</i>. And I don't believe he's
doin' anythin' of the sort. I'll
ask him&mdash;<i>I</i> don't care! (<i>Aloud,
to</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>.) I say, I know I'm
awfully inquisitive&mdash;but I do
want to know so&mdash;you've just
been writin' notes or somethin',
haven't you? Mr. <span class="smcap">Bearpark</span>
declares you're goin' to take
them all off here&mdash;you're not
really, <i>are</i> you?</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> That sulky
young chap has spotted it! (<i>Aloud,
stammering.</i>) I&mdash;take everything
off? <i>Here!</i> I&mdash;I assure you I
should never even <i>think</i> of doing
anything so indelicate!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> I was sure that was what you'd say! But still (<i>with
reviving uneasiness</i>), I suppose you <i>have</i> made use of things that
happened just to fit your purpose, haven't you?</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (penitently).</i> All I can say is, that&mdash;if I have&mdash;you won't
catch me doing it <i>again</i>! And other people's things <i>don't</i> fit. I'd
much rather have my own.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda (relieved).</i> Of course! But I'm glad you told me.
(<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Archie</span>, <i>in an undertone</i>.) I <i>asked</i> him&mdash;and, as usual, you
were utterly wrong. So you'll please not to be a Pig!</p>

<p><i>Archie (jealously).</i> And you're goin' to go on talkin' to him all
through dinner? Pleasant for me&mdash;when I took you down!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> You want to be taken down yourself, I think. And
I mean to talk to him if I choose. You can talk to Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span>&mdash;she
likes boys! (<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>.) I was goin' to ask you&mdash;ought
a schipperke to have meat? Mine won't touch puppy biscuits.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> <i>enlightens her on this point</i>; <span class="smcap">Archie</span> <i>glowers</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>perceiving that the</i> Bishop <i>is showing signs of
restiveness</i>). Well, Bishop, I wish I could find you a little more
ready to listen to what the other side has to say!</p>

<p><i>The Bishop (who has been "heckled" to the verge of his endurance).</i>
I am&mdash;ah&mdash;not conscious of any unreadiness to enter into conversation
with the very estimable lady on my other side, should an
opportunity present itself.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> Now, that's one of your quibbles, Dr. <span class="smcap">Rodney</span>, and I
detest quibbling! But at least it shows you haven't a leg to stand
upon.</p>

<p><i>The Bishop.</i> Precisely&mdash;nor to&mdash;ah&mdash;run away upon, dear Lady.
I am wholly at your mercy, you perceive!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant. (triumphantly).</i> Then you <i>admit</i> you're beaten? Oh,
I don't despair of you <i>yet</i>, Bishop!</p>

<p><i>The Bishop.</i> I confess I am less sanguine. (<i>To himself.</i>) Shall I
have strength to bear these buffets with any remains of Christian
forbearance through three more courses? Ha, thank Heaven, the
salad!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He cheers up at the sight of this olive-branch.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Earwaker</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Pilliner</span>).
Now, I don't altogether approve of
the New Woman myself; but
still, I am glad to see how women
are beginning to assert themselves
and come to the front;
surely you sympathise with all
that?</p>

<p><i>Pilliner (plaintively).</i> No, really
I <i>can't</i>, you know! I'd so much
rather they <i>wouldn't</i>. They've
made us poor men feel positively
obsolete! They'll snub us out of
existence soon&mdash;our sex will be
extinct&mdash;and then they'll be
sorry. There'll be nobody to
protect them from one another!
After all, we can't help being
what we are. It isn't <i>my</i> fault
that I was born a Man Thing&mdash;now,
<i>is</i> it?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant. (overhearing this
remark).</i> Well, if it <i>is</i> a fault,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Pilliner</span>, we must all acknowledge
that you've done
everything in your power to correct
it!</p>

<p><i>Pill. (sweetly).</i> How nice and
encouraging of you, dear Lady
<span class="smcap">Cantire</span>, to take up the cudgels
for me like that!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Shorthorn (who has been
dragging his mental depths for a
fresh topic&mdash;hopefully, to</i> Miss

asked you what you thought

<p><i>Pill.</i> (<i>sotto voce, to</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Spelwane</span>).
Have you quite done
sitting on that poor unfortunate
man? <i>I</i> heard you!</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw. (in the same tone).</i>
I'm afraid I <i>have</i> been rather beastly to him. But, oh, he <i>is</i> such
a bore&mdash;he <i>would</i> talk about his horrid "silos" till I asked him
whether they were easy to tame. After that, the subject dropped&mdash;somehow.</p>

<p><i>Pill.</i> I see you've been punishing him for not happening to be a
distinguished Poet. I thought <i>he</i> was to have been the fortunate
man?</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> So he was; but they changed it all at the last moment:
it really was rather provoking. I <i>could</i> have talked to <i>him</i>.</p>

<p><i>Pill.</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Rhoda</span> appears to be consoling him. Poor dear
<span class="smcap">Archie's</span> face is quite a study. But really I don't see that his
poetry is so very wonderful; no more did <i>you</i> this morning!</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> Because you deliberately picked out the worst bits,
and read them as badly as you could!</p>

<p><i>Pill.</i> Ah, well, he's here to read them for himself now. I daresay
he'd be delighted to be asked.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> Do you know, <span class="smcap">Bertie</span>, that's rather a good idea of
yours. I'll ask him to read us something to-night.</p>

<p><i>Pill. (aghast).</i> To-night! With all these people here? I say,
they'll never <i>stand</i> it, you know.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> (<i>as she rises</i>). They ought to feel it an immense

<p><i>The Bishop</i> (<i>to himself, as he rises</i>). Port in sight&mdash;at last! But,
oh, <i>what</i> I have had to suffer!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>at parting</i>). Well, we've had quite one of our old
discussions. I always enjoy talking to <i>you</i>, Bishop. But I haven't
yet got at your reasons for voting as you did on the Parish Councils
Bill: we must go into that upstairs.</p>

<p><i>The Bishop</i> (<i>with veracity</i>). I shall be&mdash;ah&mdash;all impatience, Lady
<span class="smcap">Cantire</span>. (<i>To himself.</i>) I fervently trust that a repetition of this
experience may yet be spared me!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>as she leaves <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span></i>). You will tell me the name
of the stuff upstairs, won't you? So very much ta!</p>

<p><i>Archie</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I'd like to tar him very much, and feather
him too, for cuttin' me out like this! (<i>The men sit down</i>; <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>

further end of the table</i>; <span class="smcap">Archie</span> <i>passes the wine to</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> <i>with
a scowl</i>.) What are you drinkin'? Claret? What do you do your
writin' on, now, as a general thing?</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>on the defensive</i>). On paper, Sir, when I've any to do. Do
you do yours on a <i>slate</i>?</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> I say, that's rather good. Had you there,
<span class="smcap">Bearpark</span>!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Archie</span>, <i>lowering his voice</i>). Look here, I see you're
trying to put a spoke in my wheel. You saw me writing at dinner,
and went and told that young lady I was going to take everything
off there and then, which you must have known I wasn't likely to
do. Now, Sir, it's no business of yours that I can see; but, as you
seem to be interested, I may tell you that I shall do it in my own
room, as soon as I leave this table, and there will be no fuss or
publicity about it whatever. I hope you're satisfied now?</p>

<p><i>Archie.</i> Oh, <i>I</i>'m satisfied. (<i>He rises.</i>) Left my cigarette-case
upstairs&mdash;horrid bore&mdash;must go and get it.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> They'll be bringing some round in another minute.</p>

<p><i>Archie.</i> Prefer my own. (<i>To himself, as he leaves the hall.</i>) I
knew I was right. That bounder <i>is</i> meaning to scribble some rot
about us all! He's goin' straight up to his room to do it.... Well,
he may find a little surprise when he gets there!</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Mustn't let this poet fellow think I'm
jealous; daresay, after all, there's nothing serious between them.
Not that it matters to me; anyway, I may as well talk to him. I
wonder if he knows anything about steeplechasin'.</p>

to consort with these pampered menials, I think I shall know
how to preserve my dignity&mdash;even while adapting myself to their
level. And that girl will be there&mdash;a distinctly redeeming fact in the
situation. I will be easy and even affable; I will lay aside all foolish
pride; it would be unreasonable to visit their employer's snobbery

<h2>FOLLOWING FOOTSTEPS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Fragment from a Romance founded on Reality.</i>)</p>

<p>He had become famous. Or perhaps that was scarcely the word&mdash;notorious
would have been better. At any rate his name had
appeared in the papers. For nine days everyone talked about him.
It was during those nine days that he was wanted. No, not by the
myrmidons of the law. He had escaped
them. His plea of innocent had been
accepted. So far as Scotland Yard was
concerned he was safe. Quite safe.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
  <a href="images/125a.png">
  <img src="images/125a.png"
  alt="Illustration" /></a>
</div>

<p>But was he safe from "that other"?
Ah, there was the point. With the
instinct of desperation he took himself
off. He hurried away. He went by an
excursion train&mdash;one that stopped at all
the stations and was called a "fast train
to this place" and "that place," but
never referred to in connection with its
destination&mdash;and arrived in due time at a cockney watering-place.</p>

<p>He was followed! As sure as fate, came the follower! Ready to
hunt him down! Ready to take him! He rapidly repacked his bag.
He hurriedly left for the station. Once again he was flying away.
Now he had chosen a prosperous city. The place was teeming with
population. Surely he would be lost in this giddy throng? No. He
was followed! On came the pursuer! Ready to take him!</p>

<p>Again and again the same thing happened. Did he go to the
Continent, his pursuer was after him. Did he travel to Scotland, he
was met in the Highlands by the same fatal presence.</p>

<p>It was useless to fight against destiny any longer. Assisted by those
interested in a popular paper&mdash;which had slightly altered its character,
changing from an authority on scientific research into a cheap
sporting weekly&mdash;he reached the Antarctic Circle. He heard
following footsteps. He tried to hide himself behind the South Pole.
But it was of no avail. At length he was discovered! They stood
face to face, both wearing skates.</p>

<p>"What do you want with me?"</p>

<p>"You were accused of murder, but was innocent."</p>

<p>"Yes," he returned, with an ugly frown. "I was innocent <i>that</i>
time."</p>

<p>"You are an interesting person. I have followed you all this way
because I have determined to interview you."</p>

<p>"No you don't," cried the pursued, drawing a sword walking-stick,
and holding the blade dagger-wise.</p>

<p>"Yes I do," shouted the pursuer, producing a note-book. "And
now tell me who were your father and mother?"</p>

<p>There was a short, decisive struggle, and then all was over.</p>

<p>"If there is ever an inquest in this distant spot," said the
conqueror, "the jury will bring it in justifiable homicide."</p>

<p>And no doubt he was right in his conjecture.</p>

<p>It was a happy thought of the respected Editor of this paper (if I
may be permitted so to say) to commission me to undertake a
thorough inspection of the guns at the Admiralty Pier, Dover. Since
war has broken out between China and Japan there is no saying what
may happen next, and it seems to me that a plain statement of our
preparedness will have a reassuring effect. So without further
preface I will relate my adventures,
taking care, however, to
give no information that can be
serviceable to the enemy.</p>

<p>I am a bit of a soldier myself
but frankly confess that I was
not nearly so much of a warrior
as my companion. We had a
pass for two, and it was understood
that nothing should be done
through indiscretion that might
endanger the safety of the
country. So if my description
is not what the dramatic critics
of the nearly newest school term
"convincing," the omission is
accounted for. We two, braving
the rain the wind and the spray,
put in an appearance at the end
of the Admiralty Pier. There
was a sort of boat-house on our
right, which seemingly contained
clothing for those who intended
to do the guns.</p>

<p>"You had better put on canvas,
Sir," said the custodian; "the
engineers are about, and it is rather dirty down below."</p>

<p>My companion was soon suited with a pair of overalls and a
jumper. I would have been fitted as speedily if the date of the
adornment had been anticipated by twenty years or so. As it was,
my weight rather interfered with the measurement. From the size
of the canvas clothing in stock, I am afraid our army must be a
skinny one. Be this as it may, I had to wear "36," when "44"
would have been nearer the mark. The result was that I walked
with difficulty, and found I could not cough. So I was rather glad
that there was no chance of meeting the fairer sex, as I was quite
sure that I was not looking my best. And I say this although I was
tied together with bits of rope, and <i>did</i> wear an old jockey cap.</p>

<p>"We will go and see the powder magazine first," said our guide,
flourishing what seemed to me to be a cheap kind of teapot, with a
light at the end of it. "It is so many feet below the level of the sea
at low water."</p>

<p>I carefully refrain from giving the number of feet&mdash;first, because
I will disclose no confidences, and, secondly, because I have forgotten
it. So down we went into the depths of the earth. The hole was
about as big as a kitchen chimney, and had on one side of it a
number of iron bars, serving as a ladder. Our guide went first, then
my companion, then I myself. I shall never forget the experience.
I have often heard of the treadmill, and this seemed a revised
edition of the punishment. Each bar hurt my feet, and each foot of
descent increased my temperature. I went very slowly&mdash;it was impossible
to go fast in overalls "36." When I had descended what
appeared to me to be a mile or so, I came to a full stop. I was
standing in a sort of empty store-cupboard&mdash;the kind of place
where careful housewives stack boxes and unused perambulators.</p>

<p>"This is the magazine," said our conductor, waving his illuminated
tea-pot about, so that we might see the place to better advantage.</p>

<p>"Is this all?" I asked, rather disappointed, as after so much
exertion I should have been glad of a little excitement. Even an
infernal machine on tick would have been something.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all, Sir," returned the teapot-bearer, beginning to
mount the ladder. He was followed by my companion. I brought
up the rear, and felt like the great-grandfather of <span class="smcap">Jack Sheppard</span>
escaping from Newgate. When I was half way it occurred to me
that it was really very wrong to allow people to see such secrets. I
might have been a spy, or a political agent, or something or other.
Yes, such things should not be permitted, and I recommenced my
exertions.</p>

<p>"Take care where you go, Sir! There's a loose plank thereabouts!"</p>

<p>It was the voice of our leader. It came from above, and had a
ventriloquial sound about it. I felt inclined to reply in a shrill
<i>falsetto</i>, "What a funny man you are Mr. <span class="smcap">Cole</span>!" but would not.
First, it was undignified; secondly, I hadn't the breath to do it.</p>

<p>"Wearily, drowsily," like Miss <span class="smcap">May Yohe</span>, but (considering my
costume) with a difference, I came to the surface. I felt that I had
been for the last ten hours in the hottest room of a local Chinese
Turkish Bath. I was so limp that had I been told that the fairest
of the fair and the richest of the rich combined was on the eve of
being introduced to me, I should not have made any effort to get
away. Yes, in spite of being conscious that I had rubbed my nose
with a smutty glove, and consequently had something in common
with the sweep.</p>

<p>"We are going to see the engines," said my friend.</p>

<p>"Only so many hundred feet below the level of the ocean," added
our conductor. (It will be observed that I carefully avoid figures for
the reasons I have already given.)</p>

<p>"Thanks, no," I gasped out; "I don't think I will go. I suppose
they are exactly like other engines?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least."</p>

<p>"Ah, then that decides me, I will stay here," and I did.</p>

<p>I am glad to say that the engines appeared to be particularly interesting,
and kept my friend and his escort busily engaged for about
half an hour. At length my companions returned. I was partially
recovered. I was no longer as limp as a bit of string; I was by this
time almost as strong as a piece of address cardboard.</p>

<p>"You <i>should</i> have seen the engines," said my friend in a tone of
reproach, "they were excellent."</p>

<p>I replied that I would take his word for it. Then we went to see
the guns themselves. Well, I frankly confess I was disappointed.
They were the usual sort of guns. Big tubes and all that kind of
thing. Rather silly than otherwise.</p>

<p>"They are only fired twice a year," said our guide, as if that
enhanced their value. And now I began to understand why the
casemates had such an "apartments furnished" air about them.
The windows had brass fittings. I expected to see curtains hanging
from above, and was quite disappointed not to find a canary in a
birdcage hanging down between the window and the gun muzzle.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" I observed, "so these are the guns! They are fired
I supposed by Number One?"</p>

<p>Our conductor was absolutely startled at my remark. Many years
since I was a Volunteer Artilleryman, and I had stumbled on a
technical term. "Number One" is the gunner of the firing-party
who fires (<i>i.e.</i> lets off) the gun. The result of this display of knowledge
was an elaborate description by our guide of the character of
the gun bristling with technicalities. (Wishing to protect the
Government secrets I do not transcribe it.)</p>

<p>Then we went to see how the gun was loaded, how it was laid or
aimed. At last we came to the look-out tower.</p>

<p>"Only room for one gentleman," said our guide; and I nobly
yielded first place to my friend. He went up, and his head disappeared.
I could only see his body from the neck downwards.
He appeared very agitated. Later on he came down, and saying there
was a "stiffish breeze," invited me to take his place. Ascending
slowly, greatly impeded by fit and fatigue, I got to the top of the
ladder. My head disappeared, and my body I knew must have
become greatly agitated. And this was not surprising. For my
body was still in the hottest room of the local Chinese Turkish Bath,
which had grown hotter than ever, and my head had apparently
suddenly found itself on the summit of Mont Blanc. Yes, and in
winter weather. For a moment it was all I could do to avoid what
seemed to me to be avalanches, frozen thunderbolts and Atlantic
icebergs. They seemed to be dashing over me. Clinging for dear
life to what appeared to be a sort of glassless cucumber frame was our
conductor. He explained something or other in a voice that sounded
as if he were a ventriloquist who was making a man say "Good
night" at the top of a very high chimney.</p>

<p>I intimated that I was perfectly satisfied. This I did in dumb
show by promptly dropping my head and climbing down as quickly
as possible. When I reached the stone floor my face was ice for a
moment and then turned red hot, following the example set by the
rest of my body.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, staggering in my imperfect fit, I once more
returned to the entrance of the boat-house. The robes surrounding me
were carefully untied in several directions. I drew off my overalls,
my jumper, my shocking bad hat, my torn white gloves. I resumed
my ordinary clothes. "<span class="smcap">Richard</span> was himself again." At least, as
near himself as he could be after a loss of about two stones of weight
and the greater part of his voice.</p>

<p>"You will not give particulars that will endanger the safety of
the State?"</p>

<p>I promised (in a feeble, melancholy tone that seemed to me like a
mouse's dying farewell to sorrowing relatives) that I wouldn't.</p>

<p>And I hope I haven't.</p>

<h2>NEWS FROM NORWICH.</h2>

<p>"Am I too sweeping when I say that we
have more to fear from drinking and gambling
than from all the capitalists put together?"
So boldly and pertinently asked Mr. President
<span class="smcap">Delves</span>, in his opening speech at the Norwich
Trades Union Congress. Mr. <span class="smcap">Delves</span> "paused
for a reply." <i>Mr. Punch</i> gives it with an
emphatic "No!"</p>

<p>It is not every working-man's friend who
will tell the working-man this wholesome
truth: that the Bottle and the Betting-Book
are his worst enemies. When he defeats
<i>them</i>, the grasping capitalist, the mere greedy
monopolist, will not have a chance against
him. Sober workmen who did not gamble
would indeed be "too strong to be afraid of
Parliament," or any other power.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Delves</span> spoke of strikes as likely to become
"an old weapon like the discarded flintlock
of a past age." Good again! But if the
workmen will organise an effective strike, as
general as possible, against Beer and Betting, it
will be the best day's work they have ever done
for themselves and their country, and against
exacting capitalism and sweating monopoly.</p>

<p>The volumes of "The Autonym Library" by any other name
would be just as handy. "It was a curious coincidence in names,"
quoth the Baron, "that, when first I took up one of these volumes, I
was discoursing with an eminent judge on some mysterious points in
the celebrated 'Claimant' trial,
a full and detailed report of
which would afford matter for
an 'Arthur-Ortonym' library
of fiction." The particular
volume which had attracted
the Baron's attention was <i>Mad
Sir Uchtred of the Hills</i>, by
<span class="smcap">S. R. Crockett</span>. 'Tis a strange
book, and the "kindly reader,"
so addressed prefatially by the
author, may have a kindly
word for it, and, "by my
troth," quoth the Baron, "the
reading of it made pass an
hour or so 'twixt meal-times
not unpleasantly," the while
he sat on the smooth deck of a
wave-conquering yacht, in
view of the hoary side of the Green Isles of Arrah and Bedad, what
time the Sea-any-monies and the coal-scuttle fish shot like blue
blazes "through the silver threads of the still and sleepy waters."
And that is how the Baron would write were he describing the
scene Crockettically. The story of <i>Sir Uchtred</i> was evidently
suggested by the <i>Strange Adventures of the Great King Nebuchadnezzar</i>,
and indeed the guileless author would so have it
understood from the headings prefixed to his chapters. There is
much about "Randolph" in it, which is pleasant, seeing that for
some time "our only Randolph" is absent from us, going round the
world, and getting himself, the Baron hopes, all round again by the
process.</p>

<p><i>Sir Uchtred</i> goes mad, mad as a hatter&mdash;("What hatter? But no
matter!" quoth the poetical Baron),&mdash;and wanders about "with a
tile off," just as a hatter would do who was so demented as to forget
his business. Then at the critical moment he is suddenly restored to
his senses by hearing, in the darkness, far down, a bell ring! Yes, he
had heard it before, a sweet church bell, long ago in his infancy....
Just as the wicked character in <i>Nicholas Nickleby's</i> first play
written for the <i>Crummles Company</i>, the villain of the piece, when
about to commit his greatest piece of villainy, hears a clock strike! He
has heard a clock strike in happier times, in the days of his innocency,
and he is struck by the striking coincidence, and he weeps&mdash;he
relents! he is good once more!!! And this is how mad <i>Sir Uchtred</i> is
brought back again to his senses, and how all ends happily for everybody
except for a certain lame tamed black wild cat, which, after
having had a great deal to do with the story, disappears, and is heard
of no more. Alas! poor Yorick! Will good Sir <span class="smcap">R. Crockett</span> of the
Pens write another little red book&mdash;("such is the colour of the cover
in the Autonym Library. But for certain 'tis a much read book,"
quoth idiotic Sir Bookred of the Swills)&mdash;informing us what became
of the cat with three legs and eight lives, one of its chances having
gone? I haven't met such a cat as this since Mr. <span class="smcap">Anthony Hope</span>
introduced us to the appreciative tail-less one belonging to <i>Mr.
Witt's Widow</i>.</p>

<p>And another book in the library is <i>The Upper Berth</i>. It sounds an
aristocratic title, doesn't it? Go not by sound save when the cheering
dinner-gong or luncheon-bugle may summon thee; and then "stand
not on the order of your going," but go and order whatever there may be
on the <i>menu</i>. "<i>The Upper Berth</i>," says the Baron, still aboard the
gallant vessel, "is the best ghost story I have read for many a day.
'Tis by <span class="smcap">Marion Crawford</span>, and not written in his well-known
modern Roman hand. Then in the same volume, by the same author,
is <i>The Waters of Paradise</i>, which is disappointing, certainly, after
the sensational <i>Upper Berth</i>. Therefore," quoth the Baron, "my
counsel and advice is, read, if you will, <i>The Waters of Paradise</i>,
only take them off at a draught first; don't mix the spirit with the
waters, but take <i>The Upper Berth</i> afterwards. For choice read it
in bed, with the aid of one solitary light, taking care to select a
tempestuous night, when boards creak, windows rattle, and doors
open of their own accord. In these conditions you will thoroughly
enjoy <span class="smcap">Marion Crawford's</span> <i>Upper Berth</i>, and will gratefully thank
the thoughtful and considerate</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">Baron de Book-Worms</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Once more ashore, and abed, convalescenting, in view of the
<i>poluphosboytoning thalasses</i> (Yes, my boy O! the Baron knoweth the
Greek is not thus, but why not lug in the name of sea-going <span class="smcap">Boyton</span>
on such an appropriate occasion?), the Baron readeth <i>Ships that pass
in the Night</i>. A deeply pathetic story in one volume, which the Baron
cannot regret not having read long ere this, as it suits his mood so
exactly now. He thanks Miss <span class="smcap">Beatrice Harraden</span>, and would recommend
the book everywhere, and to everybody, but that by now no
such passport is necessary. Certain personages and localities in the
story recall to the Baron's mind a pretty play, and a most successful
one, produced at the St. James's Theatre under Mr. <span class="smcap">Alexander's</span>
management. It was <i>Liberty Hall</i>, by <span class="smcap">Sidney Carton</span>, and the
characters were the friendless girl, played, I fancy, by <span class="smcap">Marion
Terry</span>; the somewhat cynical and mysterious lonely man, played by
Mr. <span class="smcap">George Alexander</span>; and, finally, <i>Toddy</i>, the old bookseller and
book-collector, a part that suited Mr. <span class="smcap">Righton</span> down to the ground.
Such undesigned coincidences are interesting to reader and playgoer,
and in no way detract from the author's originality.</p>

<h2>"OUR BENIGHTED ANCESTORS";</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Or, How it will Strike Posterity.</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Circa</i> 2894 A.D.)</p>

<p><i>Amanda</i> (<i>looking over</i> <span class="smcap">Amandus's</span>
<i>shoulder</i>). What <i>are</i> you so
absorbed in, my dear?</p>

<p><i>Amandus</i> (<i>rousing himself</i>). Why darling, in this very clever,
though painful, antiquarian work by Dr. <span class="smcap">Digemup</span> called "Dips into
the Dismal Ages." (<i>Shudders sympathetically.</i>) Dear, dear, how it
makes one pity one's poor, respectable, but ridiculous ancestors of
about a thousand years syne,&mdash;say the end of the "so-called Nineteenth
Century!"</p>

<p><i>Amanda.</i> Why dear, what did they do?</p>

<p><i>Amandus.</i> You should rather ask, what did they <i>suffer</i>? I was
reading a graphic, but harrowing, account of an extraordinary
annual "Custom" they had&mdash;they, the conventional, commonplace,
conformists of the day, top-hatted Philistines, "civilised" into
characterlessness, polished into pithlessness, humanised into moral
pap and pulp. It seems to have been a custom almost as cruel as
the blood-bath of Dahomey, as irrational and tormenting as the
hari-kari of old Japan.</p>

<p><i>Amanda.</i> Dear me! Poor dear deluded duffers, why did they
do it?</p>

<p><i>Amandus.</i> <i>That</i> even the pundits of the "Shrimpton-on-Sea" Exploration
Society cannot so much as conjecture. Their excavators lately
came upon a most mysterious "marine deposit" in a sand-choked
chalk-cave in the course of repairing the great South-Coast Marine
Embankment. Here are pictures of some of the items. Many of
them are mysteries whose nature and use cannot be fathomed. Here
is an apparatus supposed to have been a barbarous musical instrument,
a hoop with a piece of parchment stretched across it, and
ornamented with movable brazen discs. It <i>may</i> have been used to
scare gulls. At any rate, it must have made a hideous din when
beaten or agitated. It was discovered near certain strange semi-polished
fragments of what were apparently the rib-bones of some
extinct animals. Their use now cannot even be surmised; neither
can that of a curious wooden implement somewhat resembling a
miniature model of the obsolete agricultural implement once known,
it appears, as a "shovel" or "spade."</p>

<p><i>Amanda.</i> How <i>very</i> odd! Still, hardly <i>dreadful</i>, dear, so far, eh?</p>

<p><i>Amandus</i> (<i>gravely</i>). Perhaps not! Though the significance even
of these comparatively harmless absurdities is painful. But my dear,
Dr. <span class="smcap">Digemup's</span> researches lead him to the belief that in the latter
half of the Nineteenth Century a hideous "Annual Custom" prevailed.
In the autumn of the year, it would seem, a sort of Social
Edict of Banishment drove all decent and well-to-do citizens from
their own happy homes, to make themselves miserable&mdash;by way of
penance probably&mdash;in strange places, fusty, ill-furnished, often
unhealthy, and always expensive, far from all the comforts and
decencies, the conveniences and charms of their own well-ordered
residences.</p>

<p><i>Amanda.</i> But <i>why</i> did they do this dismal thing?</p>

<p><i>Amandus.</i> It is not conceivable that they <i>would</i> do it save for compulsion.
It is conjectured that some secret religious tribunal or vengeful
Social <i>Vehmgericht</i> drove the devoted victims to this dreadful
doom. They had to pass weeks, and sometimes months, either in
continual travel&mdash;as tiring and painful as the penitential pilgrimages
of a yet earlier date&mdash;or in compulsory incarceration in dismal
dungeons or comfortless caravanserais.</p>

<p><i>Amanda</i> (<i>shivering</i>). Oh dear, how <i>very</i> dreadful!</p>

<p><i>Amandus.</i> Dreadful, indeed! The leaders, controllers, or "gangers"
of these Autumnal Pilgrimages of Pain, were certain mysterious
functionaries called, it appears, by the generic name of "Paterfamilias."
The Paterfamilias, who appears to correspond somewhat
to the ancient idea of a Pilgarlic or Scapegoat, had, though "sore
against his will," like the mythical <i>John Gilpin</i>, to lead his family
followers in this peripatetic purgatory, suffer its worst horrors himself,
and&mdash;<i>pay all the expenses!!!</i></p>

<p><i>Amanda.</i> <span class="smcap">Shocking!!!</span> And what did they call this horrid
custom?</p>

<p><i>Amandus.</i> As far as can be ascertained, it seems to have been
known as the "Annual Holiday," or "Autumn Outing"!</p>
